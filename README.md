Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
Technique: Interactive Particle System
I am inspired by the interactive particle system technique, like the work done by teamLab.

I think this technique is a great fit for creative coding. It's amazing how simple code can be used to create visuals that look complex and natural, like flowing water or light. What I like most is that it's interactive. People can directly play with the artwork and see it react to them in real-time. This makes the whole experience more fun and personal, and it really makes the digital art feel alive.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
Technique: Making a Particle System in p5.js
This effect can be coded in p5.js. The main idea is to first design a "blueprint" for a single particle, defining things like its position, speed, and color. Then, you create a big list of these particles. The main draw() loop, which runs over and over, tells each particle in the list to move a little and draw itself. When this happens very fast for hundreds of particles, it looks like a flowing system. To make it interactive, you can simply link the particles to the mouseâ€”for example, making new particles appear at the mouse's location.
